# Tutorial: from zero to a running beacon

Start with nothing. Finish with a GA4GH Beacon v2 service running on your
machine, holding data, answering genomic queries correctly.

**Time:** about 15 minutes, most of it waiting for a Docker build.

Every command and every output on this page was run end to end on 2026-08-19.
Where output is shown, that is what was actually printed — not what should be
printed. If yours differs, something is wrong and the troubleshooting section
at the end probably covers it.

> [`docs/DEPLOYMENT_TUTORIAL.md`](../DEPLOYMENT_TUTORIAL.md), written from a real
> production deploy.

## What you will have at the end

- MongoDB 5, Redis 6 and the Django API running in Docker
- 100 variants, 50 individuals and 1 dataset loaded
- A beacon that answers `exists: true` for a variant it holds and `false` for
  one it does not
- Enough understanding of the query path to change it safely

## Before you start

You need **Docker** with Compose v2, and about 2 GB of free disk.

```bash
docker --version
docker info >/dev/null && echo "daemon is running"
```

### On Windows

**Every command on this page is written for a POSIX shell** — bash or zsh, as
on macOS and Linux. Two things break in PowerShell:

- **Line continuation.** These pages end a wrapped command with a backslash.
  PowerShell uses a backtick (`` ` ``) instead, so it treats the backslash line
  as a complete command and fails. Either join the command onto one line, or
  swap the trailing `\` for `` ` ``.
- **`sed` does not exist.** Step 2 uses it to edit one line of a config file.
  Edit that file in a text editor instead.

**The smoother path is WSL2.** Docker Desktop on Windows already runs a WSL2
backend, so opening a WSL shell costs nothing and every command here then works
exactly as written, with no translation. Run `wsl` and clone the repository
inside the Linux filesystem — not under `/mnt/c`, where Docker bind mounts are
slow.

If you would rather stay in PowerShell, the joining rule above is the whole
translation. For example, step 6's check becomes one line:

```powershell
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml exec -T mongodb mongo beacon_db --quiet --eval 'db.getCollectionNames().forEach(function(c){ print("  "+c+": "+db[c].count()) })'
```

Verified against Docker 29.2.1. You do **not** need Python, MongoDB or Node
installed locally — everything runs in containers. You will want Python later
to run the test suites, but not for this tutorial.

---

## Step 1 — Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AfriGen-D/variant-checker-beacon.git
cd variant-checker-beacon
```

**Use the HTTPS URL above unless you have already set up an SSH key with
GitHub.** The repository is public, so HTTPS needs no account at all. The SSH
form, `git@github.com:AfriGen-D/variant-checker-beacon.git`, authenticates even
for public repositories, and without a key on your GitHub account it fails with

```text
ERROR: Repository not found.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
```

which reads as though the repository is missing or private. It is neither —
that is an authentication failure wearing a misleading message.

**The directory is `variant-checker-beacon`.** The repository was renamed from
`afrigen-beacon-v2`; `git clone` names the directory after the repository, not
after the old name.

**Clone somewhere Docker Desktop can share** — under your home directory is
safe. On macOS, `/tmp` is *not* in Docker Desktop's shared paths by default, and
bind mounts from there silently resolve to empty directories inside the VM
instead of failing. That produces a container that cannot write its log file and
an API that never starts, with an error that points nowhere near the cause. This
cost an hour to diagnose while writing this page.

## Step 2 — Check the environment file exists

The dev stack reads `.env.boolean` from the repository root. **It is gitignored
(it is listed in `.gitignore`), so a fresh clone does not have it** and `docker compose` will
refuse to start:

```text
env file /path/to/repo/.env.boolean not found
```

Create it from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.boolean
```

**Then make one edit, or nothing will work.** `.env.example` is a *production*
template: it sets `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True`, which makes Django 301-redirect
every request to `https://localhost:8000` — where nothing is listening. You get
a stack that looks healthy in `docker ps` and answers nothing.

On macOS:

```bash
sed -i '' 's/^SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True/SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=False/' .env.boolean
```

On GNU/Linux, without the empty argument after `-i`:

```bash
sed -i 's/^SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True/SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=False/' .env.boolean
```

On Windows PowerShell, `sed` does not exist:

```powershell
(Get-Content .env.boolean) -replace '^SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True','SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=False' | Set-Content .env.boolean
```

`DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` ships as `CHANGE_ME`, which is fine locally. Never reuse it
anywhere real.

> If you change `.env.boolean` later, `docker compose restart` will **not** pick
> it up — `env_file` is read when the container is created. Use
> `docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --force-recreate beacon-api`.

## Step 3 — Start the stack

```bash
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build mongodb redis beacon-api
```

The first run builds the API image and takes a few minutes. Compose starts
MongoDB and Redis first and **waits for both to report healthy** before starting
the API, so you should not see connection errors during startup.

Expected tail:

```text
 Container beacon-dev-mongodb  Healthy
 Container beacon-dev-redis    Healthy
 Container beacon-api-boolean  Started
```

Confirm all three are up:

```bash
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml ps
```

```text
NAME                 IMAGE                    STATUS                    PORTS
beacon-api-boolean   beacon-beacon-api:local   Up (health: starting)     127.0.0.1:8000->8000/tcp
beacon-dev-mongodb   mongo:5.0                Up (healthy)              127.0.0.1:27017->27017/tcp
beacon-dev-redis     redis:6-alpine           Up (healthy)              127.0.0.1:6380->6379/tcp
```

Note the ports bind to `127.0.0.1`, not `0.0.0.0` — the stack is not reachable
from your network. Redis is on **6380** locally to avoid colliding with any
Redis you already run.

### If Step 3 fails with "address pools have been fully subnetted"

```text
failed to create network walk_beacon-dev-network: Error response from daemon:
all predefined address pools have been fully subnetted
```

Docker has run out of private subnets, not disk or memory. Each compose project
claims one and they are not released until the network is removed. On a machine
running several projects you will hit this before you hit any resource limit.

Find an idle network belonging to something you own and remove it:

```bash
docker network ls
docker network inspect <name> --format '{{.Name}}: {{len .Containers}} attached'
docker network rm <name>
```

Only remove a network the inspect showed as **0 attached**, and only one that
belongs to something of yours.

Do **not** reach for `docker network prune`. It removes every unused network on
the machine, including ones other people's stopped stacks will want back.

## Step 4 — Confirm the API is alive

Give it about ten seconds after the container starts, then:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

```json
{"status":"healthy","version":"2.0.0-boolean","release":"unknown",
 "services":{"database":"healthy","cache":"healthy"},
 "timestamp":"2026-10-16T08:30:00.000000"}
```

Both `database` and `cache` must say `healthy`. If either does not, the API
started before its dependencies were ready — `docker compose restart beacon-api`
and try again.

> A passing health check proves the API can reach MongoDB and Redis. It proves
> **nothing** about whether queries return correct answers. That distinction has
> caused real incidents on this project; `docs/DEPLOYMENT_PREREQUISITES.md`
> explains why at length.

## Step 5 — Query the empty beacon

Before loading anything, ask it something. This matters: you want to see what
"no" looks like from a beacon that genuinely holds nothing, so you can tell it
apart from a broken one later.

```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:8000/api/g_variants?assemblyId=GRCh38&referenceName=1&start=1000000'
```

```text
{"meta": {...},
 "responseSummary": {"exists": false, "numTotalResults": 0},
 "response": {"resultSets": [], "beaconHandovers": [...]}}
```

(Abbreviated — `{...}` marks elided fields, so that block is illustrative
rather than literal output. Every block fenced as `json` in this file is real
and parses.)

**Read that response shape carefully.** The answer is at
`responseSummary.exists`. There is no top-level `exists` field, and several
older documents in this repository show client examples that parse one. Those
examples silently report "not found" for everything. See
[api-contract.md](api-contract.md).

## Step 6 — Load the test data

Before you load anything, check that the stack is still up and healthy (a
container that exited, or a stack started from another folder, is the usual
reason a load goes nowhere):

```bash
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml ps
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

All three containers must say `Up` and `healthy`, and the health response must
show `database` and `cache` as `healthy`, as in Step 4. If not, fix that first.

```bash
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml exec -T beacon-api \
  python manage.py load_boolean_test_data --settings=beacon_project.settings_boolean
```

```text
  - Individuals: 50

You can now test Boolean queries!
```

Check what landed:

```bash
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml exec -T mongodb \
  mongo beacon_db --quiet --eval 'db.getCollectionNames().forEach(function(c){ print("  "+c+": "+db[c].count()) })'
```

```text
  datasets: 1
  individuals: 50
  query_logs: 62
  variants: 100
```

The `mongo:5.0` image ships the **legacy `mongo` shell**. `mongosh` does not
exist in it and any command using `mongosh` will fail — some older docs in this
repo get this wrong.

`query_logs` is the audit trail; it fills up as you query. Client IPs in it are
truncated to a /24 before being written, and rows expire on a TTL index. See
`beacon_api/privacy.py`.

## Step 7 — Find a variant that actually exists

Do not guess coordinates. Ask the database what it holds:

```bash
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml exec -T mongodb mongo beacon_db --quiet --eval 'var v=db.variants.findOne(); print("assembly="+v.assembly_id+"  chr="+v.reference_name+"  start="+v.start+"  ref="+v.reference_bases+"  alt="+v.alternate_bases)'
```

```text
assembly=GRCh38  chr=chr1  start=31959452  ref=T  alt=C
```

**Your position will be different, and that is not cosmetic.** The loader picks
each position with `random.randint(1000000, 50000000)`, so every install holds a
different 100 variants. A position copied from this page will almost certainly
not exist in your database, and the beacon will correctly answer `exists: false`
— which looks exactly like a broken beacon.

So capture it into a shell variable and use that from here on:

```bash
POS=$(docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml exec -T mongodb mongo beacon_db --quiet --eval 'print(db.variants.findOne().start)' | tr -d '\r\n')
echo "$POS"
```

Notice the chromosome is stored as `chr1`, not `1`. Which form ends up in the
database depends on the ingest pipeline that wrote it, which is exactly why the
query path matches both.

## Step 8 — Ask the beacon a real question

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/g_variants?assemblyId=GRCh38&referenceName=1&start=$POS" | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["responseSummary"])'
```

```text
{'exists': True, 'numTotalResults': 0}
```

**`numTotalResults` really is 0 here, and that is not a contradiction.** On this
path the counter reports matching *datasets*, not matching variants. Read
`exists` and never infer absence from the count — see
[api-contract.md](api-contract.md).

Note the double quotes around the URL. `$POS` does not expand inside single
quotes.

**That is a working beacon.** You asked with a bare `1` and it matched data
stored as `chr1`.

Now confirm it says no when it should:

```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:8000/api/g_variants?assemblyId=GRCh38&referenceName=1&start=999' \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["responseSummary"])'
```

```text
{'exists': False, 'numTotalResults': 0}
```

A negative control is not optional here. A beacon that answers `true` to
everything looks identical to a working one until someone checks.

## Step 9 — See the vocabulary handling

`hg38` and `GRCh38` are the **same genome build** in different vocabularies —
UCSC and GRC. A beacon must answer both identically:

```bash
for a in GRCh38 hg38 HG38; do
  printf '%-8s ' "$a"
  curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/g_variants?assemblyId=$a&referenceName=1&start=$POS" \
    | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["responseSummary"]["exists"])'
done
```

```text
GRCh38   True
hg38     True
HG38     True
```

And an assembly the beacon cannot answer for is refused rather than answered:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/g_variants?assemblyId=GRCh99&referenceName=1&start=$POS"
```

```json
{"error": {"errorCode": 400,
  "errorMessage": "Unknown assembly: GRCh99. Recognised builds: GRCh37, GRCh38. This beacon may not hold data for all of them."}}
```

### Why this step exists

Until 2026-08-19 the middle line read `hg38   False`. The query path compared
the caller's literal spelling against what was stored, so a caller using UCSC
vocabulary got a confident "no" for a variant the panel was holding. Nobody
reported it, because nothing looked broken — a researcher simply concluded the
variant was absent from African reference data. It was two clicks away in the
UI, because GRCh37 was then one of only two options in the assembly dropdown.

Both halves of that are now closed. `hg38` canonicalises to `GRCh38`, and a
build this beacon holds no data for is **refused rather than answered**:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/g_variants?assemblyId=GRCh37&referenceName=1&start=$POS"
```

```json
{"error": {"errorCode": 501,
  "errorMessage": "This beacon holds no data for assembly GRCh37, so it cannot answer for that build. This is not a statement about whether the variant exists. Data held: GRCh38."}}
```

A 501 is a signal a client can act on; `exists: false` is an answer it will
believe.

Note what the 400 does **not** say. It lists the builds this beacon
*recognises*, and then explicitly declines to promise it holds data for them.
An earlier wording said "this beacon answers for GRCh37, GRCh38" — which sent a
caller who mistyped an assembly straight into the 501 above, because GRCh37 is
recognised and unheld. `assembly.py` has no access to the dataset catalogue, so
rather than claim coverage it cannot verify, it stops claiming.

The assembly dropdown now offers only GRCh38, so a UI user cannot reach this —
it is for API callers.

That is the failure mode this project guards hardest against, and the rule it
produced is the one to carry into your own changes: **when the beacon cannot
answer the question you asked, it must refuse — never answer a different
question and return 200.** `beacon_api/filters.py` is the reference
implementation of that judgement and its docstring explains the reasoning;
`beacon_api/assembly.py` is the fix that came out of it.

### One more thing to notice

Look closely at a positive answer:

```text
{'exists': True, 'numTotalResults': 0}
```

`exists` is `True` while `numTotalResults` is `0`. That is not a typo — the
counter reports matching *datasets* under some paths rather than matching
variants. Do not build a client that infers absence from `numTotalResults`.

## Step 9b — Ask the same question by POST

Beacon v2's own request format nests the parameters. Every client that follows
the spec sends this shape, so it is worth seeing it work:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/g_variants -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"query\":{\"requestParameters\":{\"assemblyId\":\"GRCh38\",\"referenceName\":\"1\",\"start\":$POS}}}" | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["responseSummary"])'
```

```text
{'exists': True, 'numTotalResults': 0}
```

**The body is in double quotes, and the inner quotes are escaped.** JSON needs
double quotes and the shell needs `$POS` to expand, so single quotes will not
do here. Pasting a literal `<POS>` sends invalid JSON and the server answers
`400` with `Could not parse the request body as JSON`; the fix is to replace the
placeholder with a real number.

It must return exactly what the GET in Step 8 returned — if POST and GET ever
disagree, one of them is wrong.

### Why this step exists, and what it nearly shipped

Until 2026-08-20 this returned `400 Invalid characters detected in query`. The
sanitizer stringified the nested dict before pattern-matching, and the Python
repr's own quote matched its injection pattern — an injection verdict on
punctuation the sanitizer introduced itself. GET was unaffected, because flat
query strings never produce a repr, which is why nothing looked broken.

Fixing that alone would have been worse than the bug. Nothing in the codebase
read `query.requestParameters`, so once the body was let through the query
carried no filters at all: an impossible locus returned `exists: true` with
`numTotalResults: 100`, identical to an empty body. An honest error would have
become a confident YES for a variant that cannot exist.

Both halves shipped together. The lesson is worth more than the fix: **a change
that unblocks a path is not safe until you check what is behind the path.**

## Step 10 — Look around the rest of the API

| Endpoint | What it returns |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/` | Beacon info |
| `/api/datasets` | What is loaded |
| `/api/entry_types` | Supported entry types |
| `/api/map` | Endpoint map |
| `/api/individuals?sex=MALE` | A filtered entity query |

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/ | head -c 200
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/datasets
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/entry_types
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/map
curl -s 'http://localhost:8000/api/individuals?sex=MALE'
```

`/api/` includes an `environment` field. It says `prod` unless you set
`BEACON_ENVIRONMENT` in `.env.boolean` to `prod`, `test`, `dev` or `staging`, so on
a local stack add `BEACON_ENVIRONMENT=dev` (and recreate the container, as in
Step 2). Any other value, such as `development`, stops the API from starting
rather than being treated as `prod`.

## Step 11 — Run the test suites

The query-correctness suites need **no dependencies at all** — no Django, no
database, no network:

```bash
python3 -m unittest \
  beacon_api.test_query_semantics \
  beacon_api.test_query_injection \
  beacon_api.test_pagination_filters \
  beacon_api.test_assembly \
  beacon_api.test_query_vocabulary \
  beacon_api.test_capabilities \
  beacon_api.test_release \
  beacon_api.test_request_body
```

```text
Ran 204 tests in 0.002s

OK
```

That is the merge gate (CI also runs `beacon_api.test_environment`,
`beacon_api.test_repo_hygiene` and `docs.developers.test_docs_json`). If you change how a query is interpreted, these are the
tests that must stay green — and the ones you extend.

`beacon_api.test_middleware` is different: it imports Django, so it needs a
Python between **3.9 and 3.12**. Django 4.0 cannot import on 3.13+, which
removed the `cgi` module it depends on.

## Step 12 — Shut down

Pick the amount of cleaning you want. Each level includes the one before it.

**Stop the containers, keep everything** (restart in seconds with `start`):

```bash
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml stop
```

**Remove the containers**, keep the images and the data:

```bash
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

**Also remove the images** (the API image you built, MongoDB, Redis), to give
the disk space back. The next `up` rebuilds and pulls them again:

```bash
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml down --rmi all
```

An image that another container on the machine still uses is left alone (the
output says `Resource is still in use`); nothing is force-removed.

Check what is left. Expect no output from either command:

```bash
docker ps -a --filter name=beacon --format '{{.Names}}'
docker images --format '{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}' | grep -E 'beacon|mongo:5.0|redis:6-alpine'
```

**Also delete the data**: add `-v` to any `down` above to delete the MongoDB
volume and start completely fresh next time. That cannot be undone. `stop` and
`down` without `-v` never touch the data.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`database: unhealthy` in the health response.** The API started before MongoDB
finished initialising. `docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml restart beacon-api`.

**Port 8000, 27017 or 6380 already allocated.** Something else is using it.
Find it with `lsof -i :8000`, or change the host side of the mapping in
`compose/docker-compose.dev.yml`. On a server that runs other stacks, `lsof`
only names `docker-proxy`; this names the container that owns the port:

```bash
docker ps --format '{{.Names}}  {{.Ports}}' | grep ':8000->'
```

**`Conflict. The container name "/beacon-dev-mongodb" is already in use`.**
Another Beacon stack already exists on this machine, started from a different
folder or compose project. Do not `docker rm` it: it may be the one people are
using, and it has its own data volume, so a second stack you start here would
show an empty dataset list. See who owns it, then either use that stack or stop
it with its own project name:

```bash
docker compose ls
docker ps -a --filter name=beacon --format '{{.Names}}  {{.Status}}'
docker compose -p <project-from-the-first-command> stop
```

Never delete a volume to make a conflict go away.

**`mongosh: not found`.** The `mongo:5.0` image only has the legacy `mongo`
shell. Use `mongo`.

**Every query returns `exists: false` after loading data.** Almost always a
coordinate or vocabulary mismatch rather than a broken beacon. Check three
things, in order: are you using the assembly the data was loaded under (Step 7
prints it); is your `start` the stored 0-based value rather than the 1-based VCF
position; and does the variant you are asking about actually exist (ask Mongo
directly, as in Step 7).

**A query changed answers after you edited code.** Redis caches GET responses: five
minutes for queries (`g_variants`, `individuals`, `cohorts`), one hour for
`/datasets`, `/filtering_terms` and the dataset detail pages, so a dataset you
just loaded can take that long to appear unless you flush. `docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml exec redis redis-cli FLUSHDB`.

**Everything returns HTTP 301 / `curl` shows `Location: https://localhost:8000`.**
`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True` is still set in `.env.boolean`. See Step 2 — and
remember the container must be recreated, not restarted, for an env change to
apply.

**`ValueError: Unable to configure handler 'file'` in the API logs, container
never becomes healthy.** The container runs as the non-root user `beacon`
(created in `Dockerfile.boolean`, `useradd` then `USER beacon`) and cannot write `logs/beacon.log`. Almost
always means the repository is somewhere Docker Desktop does not share — see
Step 1. If you are on a shared path, Docker creates `logs/` with workable
ownership automatically and you should not hit this.

**Two clones of this repo fight over the same containers.** The Compose project
name is derived from the directory holding the compose file, which is `compose/`
in every clone — so two checkouts both resolve to a project called `compose` and
share containers *and* the MongoDB volume. Pass `-p beacon-myfeature` to
`docker compose` in a second checkout, or you will be querying the other one's
data without noticing.

**The build fails installing Python dependencies.** The backend is pinned to
Django 4.0.10 by `django-mongoengine`, and needs `setuptools<70`. The Dockerfile
handles the ordering; if you are installing by hand outside Docker, install
`setuptools<70` first.

## Where to go next

- [architecture.md](architecture.md) — how a query becomes an answer
- [testing.md](testing.md) — what runs, and what gates a merge
- [api-contract.md](api-contract.md) — the response envelope, and the trap in it
- [contributing.md](contributing.md) — branching, commits, PRs

Loading **real** genomic data rather than the test fixture is a separate job:
see [`docs/ILIFU_DATA_LOADING_GUIDE.md`](../ILIFU_DATA_LOADING_GUIDE.md). It runs
the tools from a container, describes a dataset in a small `dataset.yaml`
(`--dataset-file`), and comes with a public example in [`examples/`](../../examples/)
that you can run first. A dataset only appears in `/api/datasets` once it has
been registered; the guide shows how.
